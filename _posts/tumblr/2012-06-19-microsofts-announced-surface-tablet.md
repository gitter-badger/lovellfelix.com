The Surface tablets will be available in two distinct versions. The Windows RT version — which is effectively the “light” version of Windows 8 — will launch with Windows 8 in the fall, and run on an ARM CPU. While it won’t have the full desktop version of Windows 8 (it runs only the “Metro” apps available through the Windows app store), it will include a version of Microsoft Office at no additional charge.

The 10.6-inch touch screen will give the Surface a bigger display than the 10.1-inch Apple iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. Microsoft has not announced the specifics of the display resolution yet, but it did confirm a 16:9 aspect ratio.
The “Full HD display” Microsoft mentions in its spec sheet for the Windows Pro version suggests a 1,920x1,080 pixel resolution. That might also imply a 1,280x720 display (aka 720p) on the vanilla “HD” Windows RT Surface tablet.
For the CPUs, the Surface with Windows RT will use an Nvidia ARM CPU, which most likely means a quad core Tegra 3 chip, like you’ll find in the Asus Transformer Pro TF300. On the Windows 8 Pro Surface, Microsoft confirm a full-fledged third generation “Ivy Bridge” Core i5 quad core chip like the chips in current Windows laptops.
