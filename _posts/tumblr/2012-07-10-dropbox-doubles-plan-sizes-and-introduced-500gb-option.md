Since time immemorial (2008), folks have been asking us for a bigger Dropbox. We’ve heard from architects with giant drafting files and photographers with huge portfolios, but mostly we hear from families who have more than 100 GB of photos, docs and videos. And now that Dropbox can automatically upload your photos from just about any camera or phone, everyone’s adding tons of pictures and videos to Dropbox every day. As people add more stuff to Dropbox, we want to make sure they don’t have to worry about space.
Today we’re happy to announce that our upgrades are getting a huge upgrade! Dropbox Pro now comes in flavors of 100 and 200 GB, but at the price of the original 50 and 100 GB plans. For those of you who need even more space, a brand new 500 GB plan is also joining the posse! If you’re already a Dropbox Pro subscriber, just take a seat and enjoy the fireworks — your Dropbox will supersize itself automatically tonight.
All this goodness goes live on our pricing page this evening, so stay tuned. We’ve got an extra bonus too: since sharing is caring, we’re giving existing Pro users a three month Pro 100 trial to share with friends or family!
We hope that these bigger Dropboxes help you create amazing stuff Happy Dropboxing!
P.S. For those of you using Dropbox for your business, check out Teams! You get a single centralized bill, phone support, and 1 TB of space to start.
