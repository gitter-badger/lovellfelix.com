Well what do we have here? Vietnamese website Tinhte was sent some pictures of what is apparently the mythical 10” BlackBerry PlayBook! This mysterious device was first mentioned when the 7” PlayBook came out, but then was cancelled in early 2011 so that RIM could focus efforts in other areas.
From what we can see in the pictures here, this larger form factor tablet does have a slot for a sim card as well as the familiar front facing camera and bezels for swiping, but no indication on what capacity this model will be or if it would be a 3G or 4G model, assuming it ever comes to production. Though, you can see it has a 7250mAh battery onboard from the shots of the internals. Remember, the codename for the device is Blackforest, a device we saw come up many times in the past but also notably in more recent roadmaps.
