Dropbox is the latest tech company to have fallen victim to a security breach, and there’s a good chance your account is at risk.

A couple weeks ago, we started getting emails from some users about spam they were receiving at email addresses used only for Dropbox. We’ve been working hard to get to the bottom of this, and want to give you an update.
Our investigation found that usernames and passwords recently stolen from other websites were used to sign in to a small number of Dropbox accounts. We’ve contacted these users and have helped them protect their accounts.
A stolen password was also used to access an employee Dropbox account containing a project document with user email addresses. We believe this improper access is what led to the spam. We’re sorry about this, and have put additional controls in place to help make sure it doesn’t happen again.

The good news is that Dropbox has taken steps to notify affected users via email about the incident and have urged them to change their passwords immediately. The bad news is that just because you changed your Dropbox password doesn’t mean other accounts that take the same password are safe.
