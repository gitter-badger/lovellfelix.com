Google announce they’re retiring the world most popular RSS reader on July 1st 2013. 
On Google Official blog stated: 
We have just announced on the Official Google Blog that we will soon retire Google Reader (the actual date is July 1, 2013). We know Reader has a devoted following who will be very sad to see it go. We’re sad too. 
There are two simple reasons for this: usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we’re pouring all of our energy into fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better user experience.
 
To ensure a smooth transition, we’re providing a three-month sunset period so you have sufficient time to find an alternative feed-reading solution. If you want to retain your Reader data, including subscriptions, you can do so through Google Takeout.
Thank you again for using Reader as your RSS platform.


The move is part of a massive “spring cleaning” that Google began in 2011 and which has nuked about 70 of its wide array of products. The point is focus in a time when mobile technology is dramatically and quickly changing the computing world, said Holzle.
"It’s been a long time since we have had this rate of change — it probably hasn’t happened since the birth of personal computing 40 years ago," he wrote. "To make the most of these opportunities, we need to focus — otherwise we spread ourselves too thin and lack impact.
There are several alternatives for Reader users, some of which have sprung up recently. Feedly and Pulse offer Web-based RSS feeds that also have mobile apps for Apple’s iOS and Android.
As a Google Reader user, I believe this move is unnecessary. :( 
RIP Google Reader.
