What is Airtime
Airtime is a new live video service from the creators of Napster. Airtime is many things, but above all, it’s the following:
The best and fastest way to video chat with your friends on any platform. No download required, just login with Facebook and begin video chatting with your friends immediately, right in your browser.
Live content sharing with friends. Everyone on Airtime is both participant and performer. Play YouTube videos for your friends and see their reactions live.
Discover people like you. Break outside your social graph and find people like you based on shared interests.

Sean Parker and Shawn Fanning met online in a chat room 15 years ago over a shared interest in computer security and hacking. They created Airtime to explore what’s possible when large numbers of people are brought together live. Located in San Francisco, our team shares their passion for using the latest video technology to connect people through common interests and shared content.


Nonetheless Airtime popularity will increase significantly over the next few months. However, Airtime come across as a watered down version of Google+ Hangout. Deeper integration into the facebook platform may result into a serious competitive product for G+ hangout. The UI is clean and simple, and so far the product “Just Works.”
