Google has done it again. They stun the I/O crowd with some innovative products and revealed major Android updates.

It was truly a memorable first day. Google Announce its next version of Android Jelly Beans, and show case new products. The Nexus7 was one their new products I am certain all Geeks are looking forward to get their hands on. 
The Nexus 7 is powered by a quad-core Tegra 3 processor and comes with either 8GB or 16GB of internal storage and 1GB of RAM. The tablet is powered by a 4,325mAh battery offering up to 8 hours of active use.

The 8GB model will cost $199, while the 16GB device will be priced at $249. Price includes $25 credit to spend in the Google Play store, plus a copy of Transformers Dark of the Moon.
Google has begun taking pre-orders now and the Nexus 7 tablets will ship in the next two weeks.
Another product announce was the NexusQ taking the fight to Apple, which has largely dominated the landscape of music- and video-friendly consumer devices with items including the iPad and Apple TV.
Q is a sleek, titanium-hued ball that interacts via Android Beam with mobile devices to stream music or video from the cloud to high-quality speakers or TV screens. It will sell for US$299.


Google showcased some features of Google Glass, and Google+. The Google+ tablet app is second to none. 



Despite the personal Basis I may have about Google. I must admit they did a good Job today, and I am looking forward to see what they have in store tomorrow.
