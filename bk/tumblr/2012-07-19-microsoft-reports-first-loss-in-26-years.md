It’s interesting how the industry is rapidly changing. Today the Tech Giant, Microsoft reported its first lost in history. Some of it is said to be a reflection of the 1 Billion dollar lost Nokia reported earlier today. A year ago some investors predicted the lost and stated the partnership between Nokia and Microsoft wasn’t a good strategy for both parties. So said, so done!
The total lost amounted to $492 million or $0.06 per share. Despite the lost it wasn’t all bad. Microsoft revenue increased by 4% amounting to 18.06 billion. Steve Ballmer the CEO of Microsoft told investors to expect improvements in the future when Windows8 Phones and Office 2013 are launched later this year.
