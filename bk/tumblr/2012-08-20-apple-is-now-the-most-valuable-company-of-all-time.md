Apple is now the most valuable company of all time, surpassing Microsoft’s previous record set in December 1999.The stock gained 2.6% to close at $665.15 Monday, giving Apple a market value of $623.5 billion, according to FactSet data. Many analysts think Apple shares will continue to climb.

Many analysts think Apple shares will continue to climb. The average analyst estimate predicts shares will hit $721.39 over the next year, with some forecasting prices of $1,000 or more, according to Thomson Reuters.
"We think there’s a good probability that this will become the world’s first trillion-dollar company," said St. Denis Villere III, a partner at Villere & Co., which has about $1.7 billion in assets under management, some of which is invested in Apple.
Apple shares have risen swiftly over the last several years, doubling almost three times since January 2009.
Most recently, anticipation of a new iPhone and a smaller tablet has pushed Apple up 16% since July 26. The stock typically jumps in the weeks before product announcements, and a new version of the iPhone with a slightly larger screen is likely to be announced on Sept. 12, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research said in a research note Monday that Apple’s pre-announcement stock bursts have grown more pronounced as consumers have waited for the new phones, which start generating buzz months’ before their release. The trend puts pressure on Apple to deliver and to ramp up the roll-outs to international markets quickly.
Shares have also been buoyed by Apple’s first issuance of a dividend in nearly two decades. The $2.65 per share, paid Aug 16, placated investors who had been grumbling about the company’s substantial cash stockpile — which totaled more than $117 billion in June.
"Technology is one sector you have to watch very carefully," Mr. Villere said. "But they have more than enough going for them at Apple that you don’t want to get off the train just yet."
Others cautioned that Apple’s stock growth has to slow at some point.
"Even trees don’t grow to the sky," said Keith Springer, president of Springer Financial Advisors. "There’s no product in the history of mankind where the company continues to do better and better."
The previous market cap leader, Microsoft, closed Monday at $30.74 and has a market cap of $257.7 billion.
Nonetheless, the continued popularity of Apple’s iPhone, iPad and iPod products has led to earnings growth that is outpacing the stock’s ascent.
While Apple’s shares have more than doubled since October 2010, the company’s earnings are expected to nearly triple between then and the end of Apple’s fiscal year in September. As a result, Apple’s price-to-earnings valuation—a widely used measure of how “expensive” a company’s shares are—actually has declined over the past couple years.
"At some point the valuation gets too rich," Mr. Springer said. "But at this point they’re still innovating and producing. As long as they’re innovating, I will keep buying.
