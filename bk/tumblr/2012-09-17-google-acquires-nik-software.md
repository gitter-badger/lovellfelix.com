Google has acquired Nik Software, the company behind Snapseed, the popular Instagram-like photo editing app for desktop and iOS. Besides Snapseed, though, the company also offers numerous other tools for amateur and professional photographers. The Nik Software team says that it has always “aspired to share [its] passion for photography with everyone” and that “with Google’s support [the Nik Software team] hopes to be able to help many millions more people create awesome pictures. Neither Nik Software nor Google have disclosed the financial terms of the transaction.


We are pleased to announce that Google has acquired Nik Software. For nearly 17 years, we’ve been guided by our motto, “photography first”, as we worked to build world class digital image editing tools. We’ve always aspired to share our passion for photography with everyone, and with Google’s support we hope to be able to help many millions more people create awesome pictures.
We’re incredibly grateful for all of your support and hope you’ll join us on the next phase of our journey as part of Google.
All our best!
The Nik Software Team
