Today, Twitter released new apps for iPhones, iPads, and Android. They’re all-around better, with super fluid tweets that expand with a single tap, no doubt just in time to debut alongside Apple’s iOS 6 release tomorrow. The new apps also take a turn for the visual. The Twitter profile is now eerily similar to Facebook’s Timeline, asyou can post your standard Twitter picture along witha customized splash background. Then, if you scrolldown the page, you’llbe met with a thumbnail catalog of your imagescalled the Photo Stream. Swipe through the shots at will, tap on any image, and it fills the screen end-to-end. On one hand, these updates show just how much Twitter has neglected the profile. Much like the tweet itself, profiles were always meant to be terse overviews of acquaintances, not deep, exploratory tripsinto someone’s life history. On the other, the changes mark achallenge to Twitter’s core value. Its compulsive lifecasting, itsemphasis on the immediate rather than the catalogued, is somewhat at oddswith this idea ofa deeper, more intimate profile sitting on top a treasure trove of photographic memories.
