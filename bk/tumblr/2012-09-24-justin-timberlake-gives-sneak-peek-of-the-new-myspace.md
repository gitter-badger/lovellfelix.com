Is MySpace dead? This may be the last effort to revamp the dying social network.  Justin Timberlake Tweeted today a teaser of what to expect from his company. I must admit it look pretty decent :) The interface looks clean and attractive — but obviously we’ll have to wait for the beta launch to understand more about how this works.

So what is the new MySpace? The video overview doesn’t go into a lot of detail, but this is what we can ascertain so far:
Users log in with Facebook or Twitter and can then choose to bring photos or other information with them.
Status updates look similar to the mobile app Path, with photos largely displayed and user comments showing up underneath.
There is a large music component the service, which includes a way to browse albums, find popular songs and artists and more.
The music component is interesting — especially since this was historically always one of MySpace’s strong suits. What is less clear is if MySpace is building its own music service or if it has partnered with a provider such as Spotify, Rdio or Rhapsody.
