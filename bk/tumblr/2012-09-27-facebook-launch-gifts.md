Every day, millions of people share special moments with their friends on Facebook by saying “Happy Birthday,” “Congratulations,” or simply, “I’m thinking of you.” Now there is another way to celebrate those moments.Starting today, you can give real gifts to your friends on Facebook using Gifts.



Gift easily and instantly You can send gifts from birthday reminders, or from your friend’s timeline.


Choose a gift, attach a card and send. You can post your gift to your friend’s timeline or send it privately. Your friend can then unwrap a preview of the gift and it will show up on their doorstep a few days later. You can pay right away or add your payment details later. Your friend provides their address. To make sure they love the gift, they can choose the color, size or flavor that they want, or even exchange it for something else of equal value.There are hundreds of gifts with more added every day: cupcakes from Magnolia Bakery, a stuffed animal from Gund, or a digital gift card from Starbucks.
