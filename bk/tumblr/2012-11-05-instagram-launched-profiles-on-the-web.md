Two years after it arrived on the iPhone, Instagram launched a web companion for users of its photo-sharing and filtering app Monday.
The most striking thing about the new web profiles, which are being gradually rolled out to users, is its resemblance to Facebook Timeline. An animated, rotating mosaic of Instagram photos occupies about the same amount of space as Facebook Timeline’s Cover photo; a small profile image, short bio and follower stats are situated just beneath. Photo thumbnails are organized in reverse-chronological order further down the page; click on one, and it’ll appear at full size alongside likes and comments.

You’ve asked for Instagram on the web and we’ve listened. Over the next few days, we’ll be rolling out Instagram profiles on the web!
Your web profile features a selection of your recently shared photographs just above your profile photo and bio, giving others a snapshot of the photos you share on Instagram. In addition, you can follow users, comment & like photos and edit your profile easily and directly from the web. It’s a beautiful new way to share your Instagram photos!
To see your profile, or to explore a friend’s profile, simply navigate to instagram.com/[username]. For example, in order to view Nike’s profile, @nike, you’d navigate to instagram.com/nike on the web. If you don’t see your profile yet, be assured that you’ll see it in the next few days. We’re rolling out profiles to everyone on Instagram over the course of this week. You can find more information on Instagram profiles below the photos in this post, as well as in our help center.
