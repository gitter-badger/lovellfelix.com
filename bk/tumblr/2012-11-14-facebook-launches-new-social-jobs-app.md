Facebook today announced it has struck a deal with BranchOut, DirectEmployers, Work4Labs, Jobvite, and Monster.com to launch a free Social Jobs Partnership app, which in total currently lists more than 1.7 million jobs. The app comes after Facebook partnered with the US Department of Labor, the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), DirectEmployers Association, and the National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA) last year to create the SJP.

When it comes to economic growth, few issues are more important than matching qualified candidates with great jobs. In that spirit, we know that the power of social media – the connections between friends, family and community – can have an outsized impact on finding jobs.







Last year, the U.S. Department of Labor, the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE),DirectEmployers Association, the National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA)  andFacebook joined forces to create the Social Jobs Partnership, an initiative that leverages social media to connect great jobs with great candidates.

Today, the Social Jobs Partnership (SJP) is thrilled to unveil our Facebook app [https://www.facebook.com/socialjobs/app_417814418282098], a new tool that will make it easier for people on Facebook to find and share employment opportunities.

The new SJP app is a central location where recruiters can share open positions with the Facebook community sorted by industry, location and skills. Today, the app launches with employment opportunities provided by BranchOut, DirectEmployers Association, Work4Labs, Jobvite andMonster.com. Together, these developers are offering applicants access to more than 1.7 million jobs currently hosted on Facebook.
