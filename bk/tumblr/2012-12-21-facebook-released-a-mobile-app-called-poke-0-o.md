This standalone app, similar to the app Snapchat, is perfect for sending messages and images you don’t want unintended recipients to stumble across. Facebook calls this sending things in a “lightweight way.” The rest of the world calls it sexting.
"With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you’re up to in a lightweight way. You can poke an individual friend or several at once," reads a Facebook blog post.
Facebook isn’t that naive. It’s built in reporting tools to make sure things don’t get too out of control for recipients.
