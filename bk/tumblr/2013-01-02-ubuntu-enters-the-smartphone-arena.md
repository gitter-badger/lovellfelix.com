Ubuntu’s announced its new smartphone interface. 
This isn’t Ubuntu’s first foray into devices outside of the desktop. Over the last few years, Ubuntu has spent time investing in Ubuntu for TV sets and building out its cloud infrastructure. Over the last 18 months, Ubuntu has shifted into integrating more touch-friendly controls and better touchscreen support into Ubuntu on the desktop.
With Ubuntu for phones, it appears they want to offer OEMs an alternative to Android on both the high and low ends of the market. Ubuntu is also going to target the enterprise, where it can offer corporate customers a way to offer thin-client, PC and phone functionality from one profile.



Would you buy one?
