Instagram announced that its full image feed has made its way to the web, users now have access through the dedicated mobile apps to check out all of their content, and participate in the conversation around posted photos.
The web-based feed comes in both desktop- and mobile-optimized flavors, meaning you’re set if you’re using something like BlackBerry not yet graced by an official app (minus the ability to post photos, of course). Instagram has been making overtures to the web after remaining mobile-only for a long time, but this goes beyond simple flirtation.
