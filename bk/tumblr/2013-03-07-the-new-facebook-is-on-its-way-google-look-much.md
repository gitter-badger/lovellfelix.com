Facebook announced today it’s revamping their news feed UI. 
"The news feed is one of the most important things we’ve built," Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the press event. Likening news feed to "the most personalized newspaper," Zuckerberg added that "the stories around you deserve to be displayed with more than just text."
"How we’re all sharing is changing and the news feed needs to evolve with those changes. This is the evolving face of news feed."
The new news feed features three major components:

Bigger Images


Multiple Feeds


Mobile Consistency

I think it’s a good move by the company, and most users will embrace the new design unlike previous failed attempts to bring in new UI changes. It’s not as innovative as it may seem though. Most of the design principles are similar to that of Google+, but don’t take my word for it. Look at the both products side by side. 
Overall, I like the design. Thumbs up!
